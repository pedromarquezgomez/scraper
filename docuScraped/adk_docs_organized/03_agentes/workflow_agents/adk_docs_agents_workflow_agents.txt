Workflow Agents
¶
This section introduces "
workflow agents
" -
specialized agents that control the execution flow of its sub-agents
.
Workflow agents are specialized components in ADK designed purely for
orchestrating the execution flow of sub-agents
. Their primary role is to manage
how
and
when
other agents run, defining the control flow of a process.
Unlike
LLM Agents
, which use Large Language Models for dynamic reasoning and decision-making, Workflow Agents operate based on
predefined logic
. They determine the execution sequence according to their type (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop) without consulting an LLM for the orchestration itself. This results in
deterministic and predictable execution patterns
.
ADK provides three core workflow agent types, each implementing a distinct execution pattern:
Sequential Agents
Executes sub-agents one after another, in
sequence
.

Loop Agents
Repeatedly
executes its sub-agents until a specific termination condition is met.
Learn more
Parallel Agents
Executes multiple sub-agents in
parallel

Why Use Workflow Agents?
¶
Workflow agents are essential when you need explicit control over how a series of tasks or agents are executed. They provide:
Predictability:
The flow of execution is guaranteed based on the agent type and configuration.
Reliability:
Ensures tasks run in the required order or pattern consistently.
Structure:
Allows you to build complex processes by composing agents within clear control structures.
While the workflow agent manages the control flow deterministically, the sub-agents it orchestrates can themselves be any type of agent, including intelligent LLM Agent instances. This allows you to combine structured process control with flexible, LLM-powered task execution.
