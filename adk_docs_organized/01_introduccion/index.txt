What is Agent Development Kit?
¶
Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for
developing
and deploying AI agents
. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem,
ADK is
model-agnostic
,
deployment-agnostic
, and is built for
compatibility with other frameworks
. ADK was designed to make agent
development feel more like software development, to make it easier for
developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range
from simple tasks to complex workflows.
Get started:

Flexible Orchestration
Define workflows using workflow agents (
Sequential
,
Parallel
,
Loop
)
for predictable pipelines, or leverage LLM-driven dynamic routing
(
LlmAgent
transfer) for adaptive behavior.

Multi-Agent Architecture
Build modular and scalable applications by composing multiple specialized
agents in a hierarchy. Enable complex coordination and delegation.
Explore multi-agent systems
Rich Tool Ecosystem
Equip agents with diverse capabilities: use pre-built tools (Search, Code
Exec), create custom functions, integrate 3rd-party libraries (LangChain,
CrewAI), or even use other agents as tools.
Browse tools
Deployment Ready
Containerize and deploy your agents anywhere – run locally, scale with
Vertex AI Agent Engine, or integrate into custom infrastructure using Cloud
Run or Docker.
Deploy agents
Built-in Evaluation
Systematically assess agent performance by evaluating both the final
response quality and the step-by-step execution trajectory against
predefined test cases.
