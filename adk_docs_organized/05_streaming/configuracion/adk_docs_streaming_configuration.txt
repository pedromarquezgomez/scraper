Configurating streaming behaviour
Â¶
There are some configurations you can set for live(streaming) agents.
It's set by
RunConfig
. You should use RunConfig with your
Runner.run_live(...)
.
For example, if you want to set voice config, you can leverage speech_config.
voice_config
=
genai_types
.
VoiceConfig
(
prebuilt_voice_config
=
genai_types
.
PrebuiltVoiceConfigDict
(
voice_name
=
'Aoede'
)
)
speech_config
=
genai_types
.
SpeechConfig
(
voice_config
=
voice_config
)
run_config
=
RunConfig
(
speech_config
=
speech_config
)
runner
.
run_live
(

run_config
